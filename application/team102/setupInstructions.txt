This is how I made it run on my local machine

Open in project in the file explorer, find and move/save index.js and app.js in a temp location
go to the application folder and delete everything that is in there.
start new in the vs code and run the npm init and npm node.js for initial setup
run npx create-react-app team102
    that command has to have a destination folder and cannot be made from the previous folder into the application folder.
    I just called it "team102"
move to the team102 folder and run npm i react-router-dom bootstrap reactstrap
the standard react and react-dom is already installed by the create command
after that if i run the npm start command inside the team102 folder evertying starts and runs great on my local machine


####### if cloning my branch ######

switch to branch dmitry
fetch origin
go into the team102 folder
run command: npm i react-router-dom bootstrap reactstrap axios 
after that run: npm start
should all work
